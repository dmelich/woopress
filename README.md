Woopress 2.0
==============

This is second incarnation of Woopress - boilerplate for Woocommerce/Wordpress based on [Roots/Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock), [Bones for Genesis 2.0](https://github.com/cdukes/bones-for-genesis-2-0) and [ZURB Foundation](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites)

A starting point for new Genesis + Foundation ecommerce projects. This is a starter child theme, not a dependency. Includes Wordpress and plugins instalation via Composer, requires Genesis Framework for full functionality.
